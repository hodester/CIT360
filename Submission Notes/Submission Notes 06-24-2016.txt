Week 10 

Address Book App:
This week I decided to create an Address Book app that I will use for my individual project requirement.
It's still a work in progress and I have recycled some of the code from the HibernateCal app.
I need to figure out how to do a many-to-many relationship in hibernate for the many phone number to many people, once I figure that out I want to do the same for an address.
I will also have this application be a server to client type of app because it sounds cool verse a webapp.

Week of 7-15-2016

Week 13 

This week I worked on the MVC model more with my Address Book application, it integrates Hibernate, Java Collections List, and MVC together for form my application.
Working on MVC for a non-GUI application was a little confusing at first because I didn’t know what to put in the view, with a GUI application this would be all the display stuff, so I just put the display stuff in there too.

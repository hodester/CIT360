Week 11 

This week I decided to extend my ACP application and integrate it with Server Client sockets to that that application more useful.
This means that the client end could be lighter and smaller. I learn a lot more this time around with the client server because I combined it with a loop and made it more dynamic that it was before.

This week I was also pondering how I could make my Address Book application work but when I added many-to-many relationship to the mix of hibernate it got more complex and confusing.
I maybe go back to it but it adds no value to my topics if I don't do the many-to-many relationship so it's on the back burner for now.

I also worked on my use case diagram and use case document this week.

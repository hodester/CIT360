Week 12 

This week I did my diagram on a Java Turtle code because I thought it we be better to base my diagrams on working code than my group project or my own code.
I used BlueJ for the Class diagram and MS Visio for the other ones. I learn this week that creating diagram is very time consuming and that BlueJ does not extract variable names within the classes.

Week 9 

HibernateCal:
This week I have been working on a section that will be a part of our group project.
This section handles the data request from and to the database using hibernate. 
Hibernate has never been my favorite topic in all my Life in Technology which is almost 12 years.
I decided to take this project on for my group project because no one really wanted it and it would be a good challenge for me due to my history of not liking it.
I spent countless hours working on hibernate and trying to figure it out.
I have integrated hibernate with some other technologies, with hibernate I got Many to one relationship working but I have not figured out what to do with a many to many relationship for my project.
I have learnt a lot from this experiance many because of a lot of googling and looking in forums, I found the bigest problem is that hibernate has changed a lot and most of the examples on the internet are outdated.
Also don't use hibernate 5.2, it has a few bugs to I will stick with 5.1 for now.
